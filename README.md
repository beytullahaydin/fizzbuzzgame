# fizzbuzzgame
This repo is an example of a solution for the FizzBuzz game. The FizzBuzz game is played briefly as follows. In a sequential number sequence, multiples of 3 and 3 are written as Fizz, and multiples of 5 and 5 are written as Buzz. Or, if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, FizzBuzz is written. I solved this problem using PHP.
# usage
